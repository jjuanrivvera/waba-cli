You are a STRICT senior reviewer. Inspect this CLI repo: read internal/api/errors.go,
two command files, and the root --help/-h output. Score each 0-5 (FAIL if any < 3):
  1. Errors carry actionable hints keyed by status (401/403/404/429/5xx), not "request failed".
  2. Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.
  3. --help text includes runnable examples.
  4. Output/UX reads like a first-party tool (gh-quality).
End with exactly one line: "VERDICT: PASS" or "VERDICT: FAIL".
